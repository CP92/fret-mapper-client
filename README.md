## Description
A guitar fretboard visualizer. Set up your own personal tunings and after signing up you can save and recall your favorite tunings!

## Technologies used
Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Jquery, Ajax, and bootstrap were all used to create this game.

## Development process:
I started with the Grid system used for the note layouts. Set up functions to fill in the frets depending on what the tuner was set to. Once I had a functional board I started saving, deleting and recall board layouts. All saved tunings are put into a tuning selector drop down for easy recall.

## Unsolved problems
Guitar strings and fret dots are not currently in the app. Also eventually would like to add additional strings and add scale and chord support.
